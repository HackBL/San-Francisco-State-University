The program is written by java. 

Instruction to compile and run programs: 

System 1:

 *  Instructions:
 *	
 *	- Open the Zip file:
 *		 Move "sys1.java" into unix lab
 *	
 *	- Compile source file: 	
 *		javac sys1.java
 * 
 *	- Run the program:
 *		non-verbose mode: 
 *			java Sys1 tracefile cachesize		
 *
 *		verbose mode:
 *			java Sys1 tracefile cachesize -v ic1 ic2

System 2:

 *  Instructions:	
 *
 *	- Open the Zip file:
 *		Move "sys2.java" into unix lab
 *
 *	- Compile source file:
 *		javac sys2.java
 *
 *	- Run the program:
 *		non-verbose mode:
 *			java Sys2 tracefile cachesize set-associativity
 *
 *		verbose mode:
 *			java Sys2 tracefile cachesize set-associativity -v ic1 ic2

Note: 

 * All trace files are in the current directory
 
 * Since both sys1.java and sys2.java has the same class called Target, you need to 	compile every time before run them
